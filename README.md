# stutility
Some handy utility python functions that may be useful to my projects.

This is based on the steven_utils package, providing pretty much the same set of functions. The reason I want to rewrite it is because:

1. I want to do it again with PEP8 recommended coding styles.

2. I want to organize the module structure and import structure better, using __init__.py.

3. I want to test how pipenv works.
